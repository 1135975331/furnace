# frequently asked questions

> why does the cursor move randomly?

who knows? it must be a glitch, or maybe intentional...

> can you help me get rid of the nag screens?

Furnace Pro is now shareware. please register it in order to disable the nag screens.

> shareware? are you serious?

well, we need money for development and stuff. you gotta pay.

don't wanna pay? there's still one way...

> it doesn't open under macOS!

check your pipes. there must be a hammer that is damaging the app.

if that still doesn't work, move your computer to the trash.
