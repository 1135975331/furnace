# Modification disclaimer

This is a modified version of ESFMu v1.0.1 which implements a function for reading the waveform output of the individual FM channels. The modification was made by Kagamiin~ (original author of ESFMu) herself.

Kagamiin~ notes:
> In hindsight, I might merge back this functionality into a future version of the core, as it could be be useful for generating oscilloscope views in other tools.
