# MOS Technology TED

also called 7360/8360, TED stands for Text Editing Device. it's both a video and audio chip of Commodore budget computers, like Plus/4 and 16. 
It's audio portion is pretty barren - only 2 channels, one can output square wave, other can change between square and noise. Pitch range is limited as well, akin to that of SN76489, and volume control is global.
