# instrument editor

the instrument editor always starts with this section:

![top of instrument editor](instrument-editor-top.png)

- top-left numeric dropdown: instrument selector.
- folder icon: open an instrument file.
- save icon: save current instrument as a file.
  - right-clicking gives the option to save a .dmp format DefleMask preset.
- **Name**: instrument name.
- **Type**: the system for which the instrument is intended.
  - if changed, all applicable settings and macros will remain as they are. numbers will not be adjusted.

# macros

Macros are incredibly versatile tools for automating instrument parameters.

After creating an instrument, open the Instrument Editor and select the "Macros" tab. There may be multiple macro tabs to control individual FM operators and such.

![macro view](macroview.png)

The very first numeric entry sets the visible width of the bars in sequence-type macros. The scrollbar affects the view of all macros at once. There's a matching scrollbar at the bottom underneath all the macros.

Each macro has two buttons on the left.
- Macro type (explained below).
- Timing editor, which pops up a small dialog:
  - Step Length (ticks): Determines how many ticks pass before each change of value. Default is 1.
  - Delay: Delays the start of the macro until this many ticks have passed. Default is 0.
  - The button is highlighted if either of these is set differently from default.

## macro types

Every macro can be defined though one of three methods, selectable with the leftmost button under the macro type label:

- ![](macro-button-seq.png) **Sequence:** displayed as a bar graph, this is a sequence of numeric values.
- ![](macro-button-ADSR.png) **ADSR:** this is a traditional ADSR envelope, defined by the rate of increase and decrease of value over time.
- ![](macro-button-LFO.png) **LFO:** the Low Frequency Oscillator generates a repeating wave of values.

Some macros are "bitmap" style. They represent a number of "bits" that can be toggled individually, and the values listed represent the sum of which bits are turned on.

### sequence

![sequence macro editor](macro-seq.png)

The number between the macro type label and the macro type button is the macro length in steps. The `-` and `+` buttons change the length of the macro. Start out by adding at least a few steps.

The values of the macro can be drawn in the "bar graph" box.

Just beneath the box is a shorter bar that controls looping.
- Click to set the start point of a loop; the end point is the last value or release point. It appears as half-height bars. Right-click to remove the loop.
- Shift-click to set the release point. When played, the macro will hold here until the note is released. It appears as a full-height bar. Right-click to remove the release point.

Finally, the sequence of values can be directly edited in the text box at the bottom.
- The loop start is entered as a `|`.
- The release point is entered as a `/`.
- In arpeggio macros, a value starting with a `@` is an absolute note (instead of a relative shift). No matter the note entered in the pattern, `@` values will be played at that exact note. This is especially useful for noise instruments with preset periods.

### ADSR

![ADSR macro editor](macro-ADSR.png)

- **Bottom** and **Top** determine the range of outputs generated by the macro. (Bottom can be larger than Top to invert the envelope!) All outputs will be between these two values.
- Attack, Decay, Sustain, SusDecay, and Release accept inputs between 0 to 255. These are scaled to the distance between Bottom and Top.
- **Attack** is how much the value moves toward Top with each tick.
- **Hold** sets how many ticks to stay at Top before Decay.
- **Decay** is how much the value moves to the Sustain level.
- **Sustain** is how far from Bottom the value stays while the note is held.
- **SusTime** is how many ticks to stay at Sustain until SusDecay.
- **SusDecay** is how much the value moves toward Bottom with each tick while the note is held.
- **Release** is how much the value moves toward Bottom with each tick after the note is released.

### LFO

![LFO macro editor](macro-LFO.png)

- **Bottom** and **Top** determine the range of values generated by the macro. (Bottom can be larger than Top to invert the waveform!)
- **Speed** is how quickly the values change - the frequency of the oscillator.
- **Phase** is which part of the waveform the macro will start at, measured in 1/1024 increments.
- **Shape** is the waveform used. Triangle is the default, and Saw and Square are exactly as they say.



# wavetable

This tab appears for PC Engine, FDS, Namco WSG, and other wavetable-based instruments.

![wavetable tab](wavetable.png)

When **Enable synthesizer** is off, the wavetable used for the instrument may be selected by creating a Waveform macro with a single value.

To use the wavetable synthesizer, refer to [the wavetable synthesizer section](wavesynth.md).


# sample

This tab appears for Generic PCM DAC, Amiga and SNES.

![sample tab](sample-map.png)

see the [Generic Sample section](sample.md) for more information.
