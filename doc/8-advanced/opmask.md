# operation mask

![operation mask popup](opmask.png)

the operation mask toggles which columns will be affected by the listed commands. as in the pattern view, the columns are note, instrument, volume, effect types, and effect values. the effect toggles apply to all effect columns.

click any area to toggle it. a `---` or `--` means the listed command will ignore any data in that column.
