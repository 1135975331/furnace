  - **Invert**: flips it horizontally.
- **Y channel**: sets the sound channel to draw on the vertical axis. default is 2 (right channel).
  - **Invert**: flips it vertically.
- **Zoom**: size of the plot.
- **Samples**: number of samples drawn each frame.
- **Decay Time (ms)**: duration before drawn lines disappear.
- **Intensity**: brightness of the drawn lines.
